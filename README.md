# Portfolio Project for MIT

In this portfolio Project I designed and created my personal webiste using HTML, JavaScript, CSS and import some functions from Bootstrap.  I have different sections where you can learn more about me and my skills, see some of my projects from MIT and a passion project section showcasing my personal projects I created in my spare time for family members.  I also created a second page where my interactive MIT projects are displayed.  In the top right hand coener I have a scroll with inspirational wording for my viewers.  After viewing the page for 30 seconds a pop up alert is displayed reminding viewers to navigate to my project page.   

Future improvments for this website is I want to create a custom welcome message instead of using the alert function.  I also want to use reusable components for the nav bar on both pages.  Lastly I want to at style for media viewing (on phones or tablets) of my website.
