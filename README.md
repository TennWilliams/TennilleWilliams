# Portfolio Project for MIT
<img src="me.jpg" width="200" height="200">
In my Portfolio Project I designed and created my personal webiste using HTML, JavaScript, CSS and imported some functions from Bootstrap like the nav bar.  I have different sections where you can learn more about me and my skills, see some of my projects from MIT.  I also have a passion project section showcasing my personal projects I created in my spare time for family members.  There is a second page where my interactive MIT projects are displayed.  In the top right hand coener I have a scroll with inspirational wording for my viewers and there are links in the nav bar for my GitHub repo and linkedIn site.  After viewing the page for 30 seconds a pop up alert is displayed reminding viewers to navigate to my project page.   

## Future improvments 
For this website I would like to create a custom welcome message instead of using the alert function.  I also want to use reusable components for the nav bar on both pages.  Lastly I want to add style for media viewing (on phones or tablets) of my website.
